# Employee Data Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts and associated files for analyzing employee data. It provides a schema for creating tables related to employees, 
departments, salaries, and titles, as well as SQL queries that demonstrate various data retrieval techniques. The queries focus on extracting useful insights 
such as employee salary information, department management, and hiring trends.

## Features
Create and manage employee and department tables.
Query employee data to retrieve information like salaries, department details, and hiring trends.
Perform advanced filtering to extract specific employees based on name patterns, hiring year, and department affiliation.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

- A PostgreSQL or MySQL database server.
- A SQL client such as pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or any tool that allows you to interact with databases.

## Database Schema
The project uses the following tables to store employee and department data:

1. titles: Stores job title information.
2. departments: Stores department names and codes.
3. employees: Stores employee details, including birth date, first name, last name, and hire date.
4. dept_emp: Links employees to departments.
5. dept_manager: Stores department managers.
6. salaries: Stores employee salary information.

## SQL Queries
The repository contains various SQL queries that can be run after the schema has been set up. These queries extract valuable insights from 
the employee data.

1. Employee Salary Information: This query retrieves employee numbers, last names, first names, gender, and salary.
2. Employees Hired in 1986: Retrieve the first name, last name, and hire date of employees who were hired in 1986.

4. Employee Department Details: List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name,
   first name, and department name.
5. Employees with Specific Names: List the first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is "Hercules" and whose
   last name begins with the letter "B".
6. Employees in Sales Department: List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. Last Name Frequency: List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (how many employees share each
